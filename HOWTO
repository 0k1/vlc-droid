Basic how to compile VLC on Android platform.

- Get Eclipse, the Android SDK and the Android NDK.
- Read the Android HOWTO and setup all that stuff correctly.
   - Get the Android SDK Platform 2.2 API 8.
   - Create an AVD with this platform.

- Set $ANDROID_NDK to point to your android NDK directory

- (Optional) build ffmpeg from contribs
  cd extras/contrib
  ./bootstrap -t arm-eabi -d android
  make
  cd -

- Bootstrap VLC from the root vlc directory:
   ./bootstrap
- Create a build directory:
   mkdir builddir
- Go to this directory:
   cd builddir
- Launch the Android configure script:
   ../extra/platform/android/configure.sh
- Start the VLC compilation with:
   ./compile

- Go to the extra/package/android directory:
   cd extra/package/android
- Launch the compileLibvlcjni.sh script with you NDK root path as argument in order to compile the libvlcjni library:
   ./compileLibvlcjni.sh $(NDK_PATH)
- Launch the copyLibLC.sh script in order to copy the compiled libreries in the right Android Eclipse project directory:
   ./copyLibVLC.sh ../../../builddir

- In Eclipse, create a new Android project from existing source by giving the extra/platform/android/vlc-android path.
- Compile your project using Eclipse.
- Run it and enjoy!
