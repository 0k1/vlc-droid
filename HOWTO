Basic how to compile VLC on Android platform.

- Get Eclipse, the Android SDK and the Android NDK.
- Read the Android HOWTO and setup all that stuff correctly.
   - Get the Android SDK Platform 2.2 API (version 8).
   - Create an AVD with this platform.

- Set $ANDROID_NDK to point to your android NDK directory
   export ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/android-ndk

- If you plan to use the emulator, you need a build without neon
   export NO_NEON=1
  make sure it is set for both the contribs bootstrap next and the configure.sh later.

- Build the contribs
   cd extras/contrib
   ./bootstrap -t arm-eabi -d android
   make
   cd -

- Bootstrap VLC from the root vlc directory:
   ./bootstrap
- Create a build directory:
   mkdir builddir
- Go to this directory:
   cd builddir
- Launch the Android configure script:
   ../extra/package/android/configure.sh
- Start the VLC compilation with:
   ./compile
  Some module cannot be compiled at this time, just skip them with "./compile -k"

- Go to the extra/package/android directory:
   cd extra/package/android
- Build the JNI interface for libvlc
   VLC_BUILD_DIR=path_to_vlc_builddir VLC_CONTRIB=path_to_vlc_contribs make

- In Eclipse, create a new Android project from existing source by giving the extra/platform/android/vlc-android path.
- Compile your project using Eclipse.
- Run it and enjoy!
